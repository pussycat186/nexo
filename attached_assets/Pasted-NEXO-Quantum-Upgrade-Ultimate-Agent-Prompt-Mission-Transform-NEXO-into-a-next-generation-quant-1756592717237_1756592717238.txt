NEXO — Quantum Upgrade (Ultimate Agent Prompt)
Mission

Transform NEXO into a next-generation, quantum-grade secure messenger:

Beyond Telegram: multi-platform, PWA, native Desktop, native Mobile.

Zero-trust architecture: E2EE, Merkle transparency, multi-sig validation, device attestation.

VIP UX: hyper-minimalist, frictionless, customer-first.

One Agent Prompt → a full upgrade: backend + frontend + mobile + desktop.

Core Objectives
1. Security Uncompromised 🔒

End-to-End Encryption (ed25519 + x25519 + HKDF + AES-GCM/XChaCha20).

Quantum-safe crypto ready (Kyber / Dilithium placeholders).

Merkle transparency log + 2-of-3 cosigning on every STH.

Canonical JSON (RFC 8785) → deterministic proofs.

Device attestation + QR secure handoff between devices.

2. Premium VIP UX 🎨

Brand = NEXO everywhere, no Messenger, no Everywhere.

Frictionless onboarding, 1-tap account bootstrap.

AppShell topbar + KeyHealth mini + AttestationCard compact.

Smooth transitions ≤180ms, framer-motion, WCAG AA compliance.

Real-time status: ✓ sent, ✓✓ delivered, ✓✓✔ verified.

3. Unified Multi-Platform 🌍

Web/PWA: fully installable, offline-first.

Mobile: scaffold Capacitor → Android/iOS APKs ready.

Desktop: scaffold Tauri → Mac/Windows/Linux native apps.

Shared codebase, one Agent pass.

4. AI-Powered Features 🤖 (exclusive)

Smart Summaries: generate encrypted conversation digests locally.

Attested Search: local, privacy-preserving fuzzy search across chats.

Secure Agents: allow plugins to run sandboxed inside client, verifying proofs.

5. Performance & Observability ⚡

First load <250KB gz, code-split /admin & /audit.

Service worker: versioned caches, instant updates.

/metrics dashboard: latency, uptime, WS reconnect count, verified message rate.

Privacy-first telemetry: opt-in only, no message content collected.

Definition of Done ✅

bash scripts/start.sh → server healthy, DB banner printed once.

bash scripts/smoke.sh → 5× 200 OK, <5ms latency.

Manifest: "name"="short_name"="NEXO".

Title/AppShell topbar = NEXO everywhere.

Chat realtime: AttestationCard verified, Merkle proofs match root.

Mobile & Desktop builds scaffolded successfully.

Lighthouse score ≥90 (Perf, A11y, Best Practices, PWA).
