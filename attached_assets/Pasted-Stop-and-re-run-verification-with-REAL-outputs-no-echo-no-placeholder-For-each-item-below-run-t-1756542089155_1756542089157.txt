Stop and re-run verification with REAL outputs (no echo, no placeholder).
For each item below, run the EXACT commands and paste raw outputs and file sizes.
If any step fails, fix and re-run until PASS.

1) HEALTH (<200ms) + STH growth
- Run 5 times:
  curl -s -w "\nstatus:%{http_code} total_ms:%{time_total}\n" http://localhost:5000/api/health -o /dev/null
- Send 3 messages, then:
  curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/health | jq
=> Show that total_ms < 0.2 and sth_count increased.

2) PERSISTENCE (SQLite default, Postgres optional)
- unset DATABASE_URL; pkill -f server || true; start server; wait 2s
- Show logs line where it prints "Using SQLite at ./data/nexo.db"
- ls -lh ./data/nexo.db ; sqlite3 ./data/nexo.db "PRAGMA integrity_check;"
- Then set DATABASE_URL=postgres://â€¦ ; start server; show "Using PostgreSQL" log.
=> Paste both runs. Also paste the exact code block (first 40 lines) selecting SQLite vs Postgres and the migration files list.

3) AUTH & DEVICES (Ed25519 CR + refresh + revoke)
- Script:
  # register -> challenge -> sign -> verify -> access/refresh tokens
  # list devices, revoke one; then call any API with revoked token (expect 401)
- Paste curl commands + JSON responses + WS close code 4401 on revoked client.

4) WS ACK + IDEMPOTENCY (0 duplicates)
- Start chat; send msg id M1; drop network for 5s; resend M1 on reconnect.
- Paste server log line showing "Duplicate prevented" and DB count for that msg_id = 1.

5) DELETE / EDIT
- Edit < 15min -> 200 with "edited": true. Edit > 15min -> 4xx "window expired".
- Delete for everyone: show tombstone record in DB and both clients rendering "Message removed".
- Delete for me: only local client hides; DB record intact.

6) CRYPTO (X25519 + HKDF + XChaCha20, rotate/20)
- From client log: show use of crypto_scalarmult + XChaCha20-Poly1305.
- Send 25 messages; paste logs showing key rotation at 20 (and new key id/fingerprint).
- Dump one stored message row (hex len of cipher > 0; no plaintext).

7) UX / SETTINGS
- Read receipts default = true (UI screenshot or state dump), toggle works.
- TTL presets OFF by default; set TTL=5s for a message; after 5s run sweeper job; show DB row removed + UI updated.

8) AUDIT / STH PROOFS
- GET /api/sth -> paste JSON (first 5 entries).
- Run client verify function with a real leaf/root/index -> paste "true".

9) TESTS / DOCS / TAG / URLS
- Run the e2e suite (the actual script/runner, not an echo): paste the PASS summary.
- Provide links to RUNBOOK.md, SECURITY.md, CHANGELOG.md, and the git tag (git tag -l).
- Provide the deployed URLs (not localhost): web, API, ws, health, and a screenshot of the app logged in.

Do not summarize. Paste raw command outputs, file sizes, and screenshots.
